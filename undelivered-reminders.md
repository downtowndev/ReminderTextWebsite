# Undelivered Reminders

We use industry leading services to ensure we can provide the most reliable service possible. Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarentee every reminder is delivered successfully. Undelivered messages are uncommon, however some reasons a message may not be delivered are:

* The message content is blocked by our SMS provider or your cell carrier.
  * Normally you can send any type of SMS message to someone. Services like ours which send messages programatically are subject to message filtering to prevent spam and inappropriate content.
* Our SMS provider is having an outage.
* Your cell provider is experiencing network issues.
* You don't have good cell service in your current location.

We place high importance on doing all we can to ensure every reminder is successfully delivered. We are comitted to providing the most reliable SMS service possible and we hope you enjoy using Reminder Text!
