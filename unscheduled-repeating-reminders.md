# Unscheduled Repeating Reminders

When a repeating reminder is sent, the next occurrence of the reminder is scheduled. If there is an error scheduling the next occurrence, an error message is displayed in the "Scheduled Reminders" page of the app. We will periodically attempt to schedule the next occurrence of the reminder. To manually resolve the issue, you may pause and subsequently unpause the reminder. If the issue persists, please send us an email at remindertextappteam@gmail.com and we will investigate it.

We place high importance on doing all we can to ensure every reminder is successfully scheduled and delivered. We are comitted to providing the most reliable SMS service possible and we hope you enjoy using Reminder Text!
